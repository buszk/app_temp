Personal Statement Manager (Local-Only Web App)

Overview
- A static browser app under `web/` that saves data locally and writes customized variants per school into user-selected local folders using the File System Access API.

How to Run
- Open `web/` via a local HTTP server (required for File System Access API):
  - Python: `python3 -m http.server 8080` and visit `http://localhost:8080/web/`
  - Node http-server: `npx http-server -p 8080` and visit `http://localhost:8080/web/`
- Use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Arc) for best compatibility.

Usage
- Template tab: write your base PS with `<CUSTOMIZE_TO_SCHOOL>` placeholder. Save it.
- Schools tab: add/remove schools.
- Customize tab:
  - Select a school and click Generate Variant. Edit on the right.
  - Review the word/char-level diff preview.
  - Choose an export directory, then Commit to write `personal_statement.txt` into a folder named after the school.

Notes
- No server storage; all data is local.
- If the File System Access API is not supported, youâ€™ll see a message. You can still generate and copy content manually.
